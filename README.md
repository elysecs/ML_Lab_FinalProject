### Data: 
NOAA Weather - https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/crn/qcdatasets.html

US EIA Renewables Generation - https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=3390106

### Description:
This project aims to predict CA hourly solar energy generation in 2018 based on weather data using preprocessing, feature transformation, different models, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Motivation:
In 2018, 14% of CA's electricity generation came from solar. The state has a 60% renewables goal by 2030 so this value will only continue to rise. Accurately predicting energy supply is crucial to system efficiency and cost effectiveness.
